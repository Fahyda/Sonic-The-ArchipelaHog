This uses the base framework from [SONIC WORLDS NEXT FOR GODOT 4.2](https://github.com/Techokami/SonicWorldsNext), It will also be using [THE GODOT AP CODE BY EMILYV99](https://github.com/EmilyV99/GodotAP).

# What is this?
This is a Sonic fangame built to be speificaly run with [ARCHIPELAGO](https://archipelago.gg), a multiworld randomizer where items from multiple games get shuffled between eachother (More info on the site).
Because this is built with Sonic Worlds Next, the gameplay will be the Genesis/Megadrive style of gameplay, with the intention of making stuff work with AP in mind.

# Why this kinda fangame?
Well to be fair, while there are some Sonic games set up for ap already with more planning implimentation, I do still want to see how nice it would be to build an AP world of my own for a few reasons:
- I wanted to see how possible it is to impliment an ap run of my own for a future project
- I do still also want to play the classic sonic games in an ap format since I feel with the right mindset, it can be a fun time (at least if Sonic Adventure AP has anything to say about it)#

# So what will randomisation do to this game?
The main things it will be able to do is randomise what levels you can enter and the abilities that sonic and friends have

# What will be cosidered checks?
Main manditory checks will be the chaos emeralds and level completions with toggable checks thrown in (such as ringsanity and badnicksanity).
